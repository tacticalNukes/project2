# project2 - PA1473 - Software Development: Agile Project

## Introduction

This is a agile based project with our supervisers as customers.
The product we agreed on to deliver is a software that controlls a LEGO EV3 robot arm.
The robot can sort LEGO bricks based on color. The robot can also collaborate with one identical robot,
the two robots work together to sort the colored LEGO bricks that are getting delivered.

## Getting started

# Installing LEGO速 MINDSTORMS速 EV3 MicroPython
Begin with starting up Visual Studio Code, go to extentions and search for EV3.
Select the extension with the name "LEGO速 MINDSTORMS速 EV3 MicroPython".
Install that extenstion.

# Connecting your robot
Start of by connecting your EV3 robot and your computer with the microusb cable.
After that open Visual Studio Code and the project.
On the bottom left there is a small tab "EV3DEV DEVICE BROWSER".
Right click and press "connect to a diffrent device".
Is everying is correct done your EV3 robot should come up, then just press ENTER.

# Clone git repository
Begin with starting up Visual Studio Code, press the "Clone git repository" on the home page.
Go this projects homepage on github and click the green "<> Code" button. Make sure that the link mode is set to "HTTPS".
Copy the HTTPS link and paste it in your Visual Studio Code (The bar on the top of your window).

# Good to know
For the project to work you need a EV3 robot that is identical to ours.
That also means that the ports that we have calibrated in our code might not work for you.
Easyest way to transfer the code over to the robot is by using an microusb cable.

## Building and running


This is where you explain how to make the project run.
What is your startup procedure?
Does the program accept different arguments to do different things?

You should also describe how to operate your program.
Does it need manual input before it starts picking up and sorting the items?


## Features

Lastly, you should write which of the user stories you did and didn't develop in this project, in the form of a checklist. Like this:

- [x] US_1: As a user I want to...
- [ ] US_2: As a user I want to...
